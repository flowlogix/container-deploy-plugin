= Jakarta EE Container Deploy Plugin

Dev mode, and deploy utilities for Payara and GlassFish Server.
Includes BrowserSync functionality for Jakarta Faces applications.

== `dev` mode

The `dev` goal is the centerpiece of this plugin. It provides a streamlined development experience with automatic builds, deployments, and browser refreshing.

To start `dev` mode, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn payara:dev
----
[source,bash]
.Note: for much faster startup, use the mvnd command if you have it installed
----
mvnd payara:dev
----

This will:

. Start the Payara/GlassFish server if it's not already running. The plugin automatically unpacks the server distribution and starts the domain.
. Build and deploy your application in an exploded WAR format.
. Open your application in your default web browser.
. Watch for file changes in the `src/main` directory.

=== How it Works

The `dev` mode is designed to be intelligent and efficient. Here's how it handles different scenarios:

*   **Initial Run**: On the first run, the plugin checks if the application is already deployed and the server is running.
    ** If the server is not running, it will be started automatically.
    ** If the application is not deployed, it will be compiled and deployed.
*   **File Changes**: When a file is saved, the plugin detects the change and triggers a build and/or redeployment:
    ** **Source Code Changes**: If you change a Java, Kotlin, or other source file, the plugin will recompile the code and then hot-redeploy the application. This is usually much faster than a full redeployment.
    ** **Resource Changes**: If you change a resource file (e.g., XHTML, CSS, JavaScript), the plugin will update the exploded WAR and the changes will be reflected in the browser, often without a full application reload.
*   **BrowserSync**: The plugin provides live-reloading capabilities. When you make changes to your application, the browser will automatically refresh to show the latest updates.

== Other Goals

The plugin also provides the following goals for more granular control:

*   `payara:deploy`: Deploys the application to the server.
*   `payara:undeploy`: Undeploys the application from the server.
*   `payara:extract`: Extracts the application server distribution.
*   `payara:start`: Starts the application server.
*   `payara:stop`: Stops the application server.

== Usage

To use the plugin, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
